# uses

\*_Last updated: 6th March 2022_\*

I really enjoy reading about other people's setups. I read [uses this] for years
(when it was called The Setup) and [ZSA Technology Labs] (makers of the ErgoDox
EZ) also have a similar ["people" page] where they interview users of their
keyboards. And, of course, [Wes Bos] popularized the /uses page idea.

Here is mine.

---

## Hardware

- _COMPUTER_ -- [Apple MacBook Air M1 16GB 1TB] - Great computer. Apple are
  finally back! I would never have considered an Air in years gone past but I
  was in dire need of a new computer and Pro M1‚Äôs we‚Äôre not yet available. No
  regrets. I plan to upgrade to a Pro in time. 

- _MONITOR_ -- 4K [ASUS PB279Q] -- I've been waiting for Apple to release a new
  display for years. The best monitor I ever owned was the [Apple LED Cinema
  Display], but after many years of service the resolution was really lacking,
  so it had to be replaced with the ASUS.

- _KEYBOARD_ -- [Vortexgear Pok3r] keyboard (with [MiTo GMK Laser] custom
  keycaps). I generally like this keyboard, but I do occasionally knock the
  keyboard into programming mode and can't remember how to get it out again.
  CAPSLOCK is mapped to CONTROL.

- _MOUSE_ -- [Magic Trackpad 2] in Space Grey. I like using gestures when in
  "desktop mode".

- _WEBCAM_ -- The [Logitech C920 HD Pro] has been very solid for me since 2017.
  I occasionally wonder whether it's time to upgrade to something with a
  resolution greater than 1080p, but I don't suppose there's a massive benefit
  to that.

- _AUDIO INTERFACE_ -- I have a [Atom DAC] which plugs in via USB and a [Atom
  Amp] headphone amplifier. Very clean sound that took some adjustment at first.
  I now hear things in music that I never heard before, so I guess that's good.

- _HUB/DOCK_ -- Everything is hooked together using a [OWC Thunderbolt Dock]
  (OWCTB4DOCK). Expensive, but works well and is reliable.

- _HEADPHONES_ -- [Shure SE425] IEMs with [SnugsPro] custom ear moulds. I've
  been a big fan of Shure headphones for years having owned 5 or 6 different
  models over the years (they tend to break, but I don't like anything else).

- _SPEAKERS_ -- [Audioengine A2] powered speakers. Not currently plugged in, for
  reasons.

- [Apple iPhone 13] phone. I really like this phone. However, for some reason, in
  the heat of the moment, I decided to go for Gold. No idea why, I‚Äôm a space
  grey guy normally. I'll try not to do _that_ again.

- _WATCH_ -- [Apple Watch Series 7 GPS, 45mm Midnight Aluminium Case] with Dark
  Cherry Sport Band, for gym use, and Black/Pure Platinum Nike Sport Loop, for
  general use.

  Over-engineered notification delivery system.

- _TABLET_ -- [Apple iPad mini Wi‚ÄëFi 64GB] in Starlight with the 2nd generation
  [Apple Pencil]. I regularly forget I have it, but I like it a lot.

- _NETWORKING_ -- I went all in on Ubiquiti a few years ago. The controller
  software is really nice, and it has been solid for me. A Unifi [USG] brings
  Internet in to the property, which is distributed via [US-8-60W] switch, and
  [UAP-AC-PRO] wifi access point. I also have a smaller [Switch Flex Mini] in my
  office connected using PoE.

## Desk setup

- [IKEA Bekant] Standing desk - It‚Äôs done me well for the price, but starting to
  sound a bit creaky. I would like to replace it with something that has
  settings so I can start/stop it at the correct height quickly.

- Steelcase Leap V1 Chair - bought second-hand, and in need of replacement. [I've
  attempted to replace this chair and failed]. Trying chairs before buying is
  strangely difficult.

- [Fully Jarvis Dual Monitor arm] with laptop tray - this is new-ish, and allows
  me to position the laptop in relation to my main screen. I used a [Rain Design
  mStand] for years and recommend it, but I wanted to free up space on my desk,
  and the dual monitor arm allows that. It has some wobble, but I blame the
  desk for that.

## Software

- Terminal font of choice is [JetBrains Mono] in 18 points. That might sound
  pretty big for a terminal but it's easier on the eyes, and I think encourages
  better code as you can't fit as much text on single page.

- My text editor of choice is [Neovim] which runs inside [iTerm] using the
  [moonlight.nvim] colorscheme.

- I use [Fish] as my shell -- I just like the defaults. A lot of stuff just
  works, and it has a lot less unix baggage than other shells.

- My [Dotfiles] are available on GitHub should you be interested in seeing a
  mess of barely understood Vimscript.

## Web hosting / email

- My various email accounts are handled by [Fastmail]* after years of Google
  Mail. I'm glad to me free of Google for email.

- Saying that, I still use them for my calendaring needs -- _at the moment_ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- [DNSimple]* for DNS. They have a great interface. I was grandfathered in to a
  good deal years ago which has kept me with them. Inertia is keeping me there
  for now, despite price increases.

- This webpage is hosted on [GitHub Pages] -- a very good setup for me.

- [weeknotes.elver.me] is built with Hugo and hosted on [Netlify], the first
  time I've hosted something there. I chose them because I really like their
  integration with GitHub which allows me to preview the site before I publish.
  And it's free, obvs.

- [jordanelver.co.uk] is built with [Middleman] and hosted on Amazon S3 with
  Cloudfront. I might move it to Netlify.
