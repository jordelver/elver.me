I really enjoy reading about other people's setups. I read [uses this] for years
(when it was called The Setup) and [ZSA Technology Labs] (makers of the ErgoDox
EZ) also have a similar ["people" page] where they interview users of their
keyboards. And, of course, [Wes Bos] popularized the /uses page idea.

Here is mine.

---

## Hardware

- _COMPUTER_ -- [Apple MacBook Pro M4 14"] with 48GB memory and 2TB disk in
  Space Black.

- _MONITOR_ -- [Apple Studio Display] with regular glass. Almost everything I've
  been waiting for since 2016. Time to get rid of the disappointing [ASUS
  PB279Q]. The speakers are very good, but it's true, the webcam is _not_.

- _KEYBOARD_ -- [Vortexgear Pok3r] keyboard (with [GMK Dracula] custom
  keycaps). I generally like this keyboard, but I do occasionally knock the
  keyboard into programming mode and can't remember how to get it out again.
  CAPSLOCK is mapped to CONTROL.

- _MOUSE_ -- [Magic Trackpad 2] in Black. I like using gestures when in "desktop
  mode".

- _WEBCAM_ -- The [Logitech C920 HD Pro] has been very solid for me since 2017.
  I occasionally wonder whether it's time to upgrade to something with a
  resolution greater than 1080p, but I don't suppose there's a massive benefit
  to that.

- _AUDIO INTERFACE_ -- I have a [Atom DAC] which plugs in via USB and a [Atom
  Amp] headphone amplifier. Very clean sound that took some adjustment at first.
  I now hear things in music that I never heard before, so I guess that's good.
  I have to power-cycle it almost every day to make it work ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

- _HUB/DOCK_ -- Everything is hooked together using a [OWC Thunderbolt Dock]
  (OWCTB4DOCK). Expensive, but works well and is reliable.

- _HEADPHONES_ -- A pair of [Apple AirPod Pros] (USB-C version) which I bought
  for their noise cancelling abilities, but they have taken over completely
  because they just _so_ convenient despite their software quirks.

  I also have a pair [Shure SE425] IEMs with [SnugsPro] custom ear moulds. I've
  been a big fan of Shure headphones for years having owned 5 or 6 different
  models (they tend to break), but they sit in a drawer now.

- _SPEAKERS_ -- [Audioengine A2] powered speakers. Not currently plugged in, for
  reasons.

- _PHONE_ -- [Apple iPhone 15 Pro]. ~~USB-C where art thou?~~ USB-C! Ensconced
  in a [Bellroy case].

- _WATCH_ -- [Apple Watch Ultra 2] GPS + Cellular 49mm Black Titanium Case with
  Black Trail Loop.

  Over-engineered notification delivery system.

- _TABLET_ -- [Apple iPad Pro 11-inch (4th generation)] with the 2nd generation
  [Apple Pencil]. Mainly for watching TV in bed.

- _NETWORKING_ -- I went all in on Ubiquiti a few years ago. The controller
  software is really nice, and it has been solid for me. A UniFi [USG] (pdf)
  brings Internet in to the property, which is distributed via [US-8-60W]
  switch, and [UAP-AC-PRO] wifi access point.

- _PERSONAL SERVER / NAS_ -- A custom built PC running [Ubuntu]. It's a Intel(R)
  Core(TM) i3-8100 CPU @ 3.60GHz with 48TB of storage comprised of 6 Western
  Digital 18TB Red disks in a 3-mirror layout managed by [ZFS]. I cannot
  recommend ZFS enough -- I've recovered and replaced all disks and it was very
  straightforward.

  It runs [Plex], and a few other services. 

- _NETWORK APPLIANCE_ -- For running the [UniFi controller software]. A
  super-slim [Lenovo ThinkCentre M900 Desktop PC] with Intel(R) Core(TM)
  i5-6500T CPU running @ 2.5GHz. 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD. Mounted inside a
  cupboard using a [VESA adaptor].

## Desk setup

- [IKEA Bekant] Standing desk - It‚Äôs done me well for the price, but starting to
  sound a bit creaky. I would like to replace it with something that has
  settings so I can start/stop it at the correct height quickly.

- [Steelcase Gesture Chair] -- a brand new purchase which was really needed.
  Replaced my previous Steelcase Leap V1, which I bought second-hand.

- [Fully Jarvis Dual Monitor arm] with laptop tray - this is new-ish, and allows
  me to position the laptop in relation to my main screen. I used a [Rain Design
  mStand] for years and recommend it, but I wanted to free up space on my desk,
  and the dual monitor arm allows that. It has some wobble, but I blame the
  desk for that.

## Software

- Terminal font of choice is [JetBrains Mono] in 18 points. That might sound
  pretty big for a terminal but it's easier on the eyes, and I think encourages
  better code as you can't fit as much text on single page.

- My text editor of choice is [Neovim] which runs inside [iTerm] using the
  [moonlight.nvim] colorscheme.

- I use [Fish] as my shell -- I just like the defaults. A lot of stuff just
  works, and it has a lot less unix baggage than other shells.

- My [Dotfiles] are available on GitHub should you be interested in seeing a
  mess of barely understood Lua and Vimscript.

## Web hosting / email

- My various email accounts are handled by [Fastmail]* after years of Google
  Mail. I'm glad to be free of Google for email.

- Saying that, I still use them for my calendaring needs -- _at the moment_ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- [DNSimple]* for DNS. They have a great interface. I was grandfathered in to a
  good deal years ago which has kept me with them. Inertia is keeping me there
  for now, despite price increases.

- [Porkbun] for domain registration. 90s-stylee, but seems good.

- This webpage is hosted on [GitHub Pages] -- a very good setup for me.

- [weeknotes.elver.me] is built with Hugo and hosted on [Netlify], the first
  time I've hosted something there. I chose them because I really like their
  integration with GitHub which allows me to preview the site before I publish.
  And it's free, obvs.

- [jordanelver.co.uk] is built with [Middleman] and hosted on Amazon S3 with
  Cloudfront. I might move it to Netlify.
