<p>*<em>Last updated: 1st December 2024</em>*
[<a href="https://elver.me/uses/changelog.rss">changelog rss</a>]</p>
<p>I really enjoy reading about other people&rsquo;s setups. I read <a href="https://usesthis.com">uses this</a> for years
(when it was called The Setup) and <a href="https://zsa.io">ZSA Technology Labs</a> (makers of the ErgoDox
EZ) also have a similar <a href="https://people.zsa.io">&ldquo;people&rdquo; page</a> where they interview users of their
keyboards. And, of course, <a href="https://wesbos.com/uses">Wes Bos</a> popularized the /uses page idea.</p>
<p>Here is mine.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>COMPUTER</em> &ndash; <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-air/">Apple MacBook Air M1 16GB 1TB</a> - Great computer. Apple are
finally back! I would never have considered an Air in years gone past but I
was in dire need of a new computer and Pro M1‚Äôs we‚Äôre not yet available. No
regrets. <del>I plan to upgrade to a Pro in time.</del> Not sure about this statement
any more, the latest 15&quot; Air is tempting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>MONITOR</em> &ndash; <a href="https://www.apple.com/studio-display/">Apple Studio Display</a> with regular glass. Almost everything I&rsquo;ve
been waiting for since 2016. Time to get rid of the disappointing <a href="https://www.asus.com/Commercial-Monitors/PB279Q/">ASUS
PB279Q</a>. The speakers are very good, but it&rsquo;s true, the webcam is <em>not</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>KEYBOARD</em> &ndash; <a href="http://www.vortexgear.tw/vortex2_2.asp?kind=47&amp;kind2=220&amp;kind3=&amp;kind4=1006">Vortexgear Pok3r</a> keyboard (with <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=115268.0">GMK Dracula</a> custom
keycaps). I generally like this keyboard, but I do occasionally knock the
keyboard into programming mode and can&rsquo;t remember how to get it out again.
CAPSLOCK is mapped to CONTROL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>MOUSE</em> &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Trackpad_2">Magic Trackpad 2</a> in Space Grey. I like using gestures when in
&ldquo;desktop mode&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>WEBCAM</em> &ndash; The <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/webcams/c920-pro-hd-webcam.960-001055.html">Logitech C920 HD Pro</a> has been very solid for me since 2017.
I occasionally wonder whether it&rsquo;s time to upgrade to something with a
resolution greater than 1080p, but I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s a massive benefit
to that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>AUDIO INTERFACE</em> &ndash; I have a <a href="https://jdslabs.com/product/atom-dac-plus/">Atom DAC</a> which plugs in via USB and a <a href="https://jdslabs.com/product/atom-amp/">Atom
Amp</a> headphone amplifier. Very clean sound that took some adjustment at first.
I now hear things in music that I never heard before, so I guess that&rsquo;s good.
I have to power-cycle it almost every day to make it work ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>HUB/DOCK</em> &ndash; Everything is hooked together using a <a href="https://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbolt-dock">OWC Thunderbolt Dock</a>
(OWCTB4DOCK). Expensive, but works well and is reliable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>HEADPHONES</em> &ndash; <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-GB/products/earphones/se425cl">Shure SE425</a> IEMs with <a href="https://snugs.com/product/snugspro-iems/">SnugsPro</a> custom ear moulds. I&rsquo;ve
been a big fan of Shure headphones for years having owned 5 or 6 different
models over the years (they tend to break).</p>
<p>I also have a pair of <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/airpods-pro/specs/">Apple AirPod Pros</a> (USB-C version) which I bought for
their noise cancelling abilities, but they are rapidly taking over as my main
headphones because they just <em>so</em> convenient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>SPEAKERS</em> &ndash; <a href="https://audioengineusa.com/shop/wirelessspeakers/a2-wireless-computer-speakers/">Audioengine A2</a> powered speakers. Not currently plugged in, for
reasons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>PHONE</em> &ndash; <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-15-pro/">Apple iPhone 15 Pro</a>. <del>USB-C where art thou?</del> USB-C! Ensconced
in a <a href="https://bellroy.com/products/phone-case?color=cobalt&amp;material=leather&amp;size=i15pro">Bellroy case</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>WATCH</em> &ndash; <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-watch-series-7/">Apple Watch Series 7 GPS, 45mm Midnight Aluminium Case</a> with Dark
Cherry Sport Band, for gym use, and Black/Pure Platinum Nike Sport Loop, for
general use.</p>
<p>Over-engineered notification delivery system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>TABLET</em> &ndash; <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/">Apple iPad Pro 11-inch (4th generation)</a> with the 2nd generation
<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>. Mainly for watching TV in bed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>NETWORKING</em> &ndash; I went all in on Ubiquiti a few years ago. The controller
software is really nice, and it has been solid for me. A UniFi <a href="https://dl.ubnt.com/datasheets/unifi/UniFi_Security_Gateway_DS.pdf">USG</a> (pdf)
brings Internet in to the property, which is distributed via <a href="https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-switching/products/unifi-switch-8-60w">US-8-60W</a>
switch, and <a href="https://eu.store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-wireless/products/unifi-ac-pro">UAP-AC-PRO</a> wifi access point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>PERSONAL SERVER / NAS</em> &ndash; A custom built PC running <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>. It&rsquo;s a Intel(R)
Core(TM) i3-8100 CPU @ 3.60GHz with 48TB of storage comprised of 6 Western
Digital 18TB Red disks in a 3-mirror layout managed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a>. I cannot
recommend ZFS enough &ndash; I&rsquo;ve recovered and replaced all disks and it was very
straightforward.</p>
<p>It runs <a href="https://www.plex.tv">Plex</a>, and a few other services including the UniFi controller
software.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="desk-setup">Desk setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/bekant-desk-sit-stand-white-stained-oak-veneer-white-s19282085/">IKEA Bekant</a> Standing desk - It‚Äôs done me well for the price, but starting to
sound a bit creaky. I would like to replace it with something that has
settings so I can start/stop it at the correct height quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.steelcase.com/products/office-chairs/gesture/">Steelcase Gesture Chair</a> &ndash; a brand new purchase which was really needed.
Replaced my previous Steelcase Leap V1, which I bought second-hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.fully.com/accessories/monitor-arms/jarvis-dual-monitor-arm.html">Fully Jarvis Dual Monitor arm</a> with laptop tray - this is new-ish, and allows
me to position the laptop in relation to my main screen. I used a <a href="https://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand.html">Rain Design
mStand</a> for years and recommend it, but I wanted to free up space on my desk,
and the dual monitor arm allows that. It has some wobble, but I blame the
desk for that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Terminal font of choice is <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a> in 18 points. That might sound
pretty big for a terminal but it&rsquo;s easier on the eyes, and I think encourages
better code as you can&rsquo;t fit as much text on single page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My text editor of choice is <a href="https://neovim.io">Neovim</a> which runs inside <a href="https://iterm2.com">iTerm</a> using the
<a href="https://github.com/shaunsingh/moonlight.nvim">moonlight.nvim</a> colorscheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use <a href="https://fishshell.com">Fish</a> as my shell &ndash; I just like the defaults. A lot of stuff just
works, and it has a lot less unix baggage than other shells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/jordelver/dotfiles">Dotfiles</a> are available on GitHub should you be interested in seeing a
mess of barely understood Lua and Vimscript.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="web-hosting--email">Web hosting / email</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My various email accounts are handled by <a href="https://ref.fm/u24148536">Fastmail</a>* after years of Google
Mail. I&rsquo;m glad to be free of Google for email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saying that, I still use them for my calendaring needs &ndash; <em>at the moment</em> ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://dnsimple.com/r/d7a9918c2a5dd7">DNSimple</a>* for DNS. They have a great interface. I was grandfathered in to a
good deal years ago which has kept me with them. Inertia is keeping me there
for now, despite price increases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a> for domain registration. 90s-stylee, but seems good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This webpage is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> &ndash; a very good setup for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://weeknotes.elver.me">weeknotes.elver.me</a> is built with Hugo and hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, the first
time I&rsquo;ve hosted something there. I chose them because I really like their
integration with GitHub which allows me to preview the site before I publish.
And it&rsquo;s free, obvs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://jordanelver.co.uk">jordanelver.co.uk</a> is built with <a href="https://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a> and hosted on Amazon S3 with
Cloudfront. I might move it to Netlify.</p>
