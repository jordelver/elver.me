      <h1 id="touch-id-trackpad-build">Touch ID Trackpad build</h1>
<p>*<em>Last updated: 13th December 2025</em>*</p>
<hr>
<p>I built this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6955798">Hidden Touch ID for Apple Magic Trackpad</a>.</p>
<p>From the project page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Touch ID is super convenient when using macOS, but it is restricted to Apple
keyboards and those are not really something I enjoy or want to keep on my
desk. SnazzyLabs' standalone Touch ID module inspired me to build something
similar, yet I wanted to avoid having an additional box on my desk. So I set
out to seamlessly attach the Touch ID button to something that&rsquo;s always
sitting on my desk: Apple&rsquo;s Magic Trackpad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is to transplant the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_ID">Touch ID</a> button from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Keyboard_(Mac)#Third_generation">Apple Magic Keyboard</a>
into a 3D-printed case which augments an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Trackpad">Apple Magic Trackpad</a>. This gives
easier access to a Touch ID button. In my case, my main computer is a Macbook
Pro which sits on a monitor arm off the desk which makes accessing the Touch ID
on the Macbook annoying. The idea of this is to bring it within reach.</p>
<p>These are the steps I followed to complete the project.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before I started I needed a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Donor keyboard, I used Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID USB-C version (model
A3118) acquired from eBay. It was Swedish language, which made it slightly
cheaper on the UK eBay.</p>
<p>(In fact, it ended up being free due to eBay/Evri incompetence &ndash; sweet.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torx#Sizing:~:text=0.07%E2%80%930.09-,T3,-0.047">T-3 screw driver</a> bit for the screws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spudger">spudgers</a> and prying tools for keyboard disassembly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 3D printed case made of various pieces &ndash; see below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And, of course, an Apple Trackpad. Mine was a version 3.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3d-printing-the-case">3D printing the case</h2>
<p>My original plan was to get this printed by a friend or use a service like
<a href="https://www.pcbway.com/rapid-prototyping/manufacture/?type=2">PCBWay</a>, but I had acquired a 3D printer by the time I needed it, so I ended
up printing it myself.</p>
<p>I printed the case on my <a href="https://bambulab.com/en/a1">Bambu A1</a> using the <a href="https://uk.store.bambulab.com/products/pla-basic-filament?id=40674109751356">Bambu Basic PLA in Gray (10103)</a>.
This was one of my first ever 3D prints, so I don&rsquo;t know how well it will last,
but it looks pretty good.</p>
<p>These are the STL files I used for the print. See the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6955798/files">full list on the project
page</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trackpad3_Touch_ID_body_USB-C_v2.stl</li>
<li>Trackpad3_Touch_ID_lid_v2.stl</li>
<li>Trackpad_Touch_ID_clickplate_v2.stl</li>
<li>Trackpad_Touch_ID_clickplate_simple_v2.stl</li>
<li>Trackpad_Touch_ID_keycap_v2.stl</li>
<li>Trackpad_Touch_ID_wedge_v2.stl</li>
</ul>
<p>The project author supplies two different click plates (this is where the Touch
ID button will attach later) &ndash; one has a slot for the gasket cylinder from the
keyboard which apparently makes the button clickier. I printed both because I
wasn&rsquo;t sure which one I was going to go with and they are small pieces, so I was
willing to spend the filament to try both.</p>
<p>After printing I ended up with these parts.</p>
<div class="photos">

</div>
<h2 id="donor-keyboard-disassembly">Donor keyboard disassembly</h2>
<p>Before putting everything together I had to disassemble the donor keyboard to
harvest all the bits and pieces. I don&rsquo;t have photos of the keyboard disassembly
unfortunately because I forgot to take them. Let&rsquo;s just say that that keyboard
is no more. It has ceased to be. I would thank it for it&rsquo;s service, but I never
used it.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://gist.github.com/KhaosT/1406a6b6bea38f59e059c2afcb39d545">disassembly guide</a>, which I failed to follow, but that you might find
useful.</p>
<p>Here are all the pieces I ended up with.</p>
<div class="photos">
<p><a href="images/all-the-keyboard-parts.webp"><img src="images/all-the-keyboard-parts.webp" alt="Salvaged parts from disassembly. Touch ID sensor with flex cable, button plate, battery, rubber feet, PCB, and screws are shown."></a></p>
</div>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure which screws I&rsquo;d need, but there were far more than are required
for this build, so I just kept them all just in case.</p>
<h2 id="the-build">The build</h2>
<p>The steps I follow here are more or less the same as the &ldquo;official&rdquo;
instructions, but show exactly what I did.</p>
<p>First things, first. I attached the feet to the main case. The feet have small
tabs that fit into slots on the base so lining them up is straightforward
enough, if not a bit fiddly. I used a dab of super glue too.</p>
<div class="photos">
<p><a href="images/3d-printed-case-and-feet.webp"><img src="images/3d-printed-case-and-feet.webp" alt="Case without feet attached and 4 rubber feet from the donor keyboard"></a></p>

</div>
<p>Next I put the keyboard PCB into the case and screwed it down using some of the
larger screws. The screws are self-tapping as the original instructions said,
but were slightly tricky to get going. A bit of firm pressure got them in place.</p>
<div class="photos">

<p><a href="images/pcb-installed-zoomed.webp"><img src="images/pcb-installed-zoomed.webp" alt="Zoomed in view of the PCB with screws installed"></a></p>
</div>
<p>As I said before, I wasn&rsquo;t sure which clickplate to use. I opted for the
non-simple version in the end (Trackpad_Touch_ID_clickplate_v2.stl) and had to
super glue the gasket cylinder into the small cut-out.</p>
<div class="photos">
<p><a href="images/clickplate-and-gasket-cylinder.webp"><img src="images/clickplate-and-gasket-cylinder.webp" alt="Clickplate and gasket cylinder"></a></p>
<p><a href="images/clickplate-with-gasket-cylinder-mounted.webp"><img src="images/clickplate-with-gasket-cylinder-mounted.webp" alt="Gasket cylinder glued into clickplate"></a></p>
</div>
<p>Then I moved onto the Touch ID sensor/button itself. The button needed to be
mounted into the mounting plate. The mounting plate then pushes into the main
case. The button orientation was made clear by the rounded corners on both the
button and case part.</p>
<div class="photos">
<p><a href="images/touch-id-sensor-parts-and-mounting-plate.webp"><img src="images/touch-id-sensor-parts-and-mounting-plate.webp" alt="Touch ID sensor mounting plate and sensor ready to be installed"></a></p>
<p><a href="images/touch-id-sensor-mounted.webp"><img src="images/touch-id-sensor-mounted.webp" alt="Touch ID sensor mounted into mounting plate"></a></p>
</div>
<p>Now I could put the whole assembly in place. The flex cable went through the
slot by button and was then thread up along the top next to the PCB. The cable
seemed resilient enough, but I was careful to not bend it too much. I then
connected it to the PCB. Finally, I clicked the mounting plate into the button
slot.</p>
<div class="photos">
<p><a href="images/mounting-plate-installed.webp"><img src="images/mounting-plate-installed.webp" alt="Touch ID button slotted into case with flex cable routed inside"></a></p>
<p><a href="images/flex-cable-routed.webp"><img src="images/flex-cable-routed.webp" alt="Touch ID sensor flex cable routed neatly inside case"></a></p>
<p><a href="images/flex-cable-routed-zoomed.webp"><img src="images/flex-cable-routed-zoomed.webp" alt="Zoomed in view of the Touch ID sensor flex cable routed"></a></p>
</div>
<p>The USB-C connector was still flapping about at this point, but inserting the
&ldquo;wedge&rdquo; (<code>Trackpad_Touch_ID_wedge_v2.stl</code>) easily secured it and stopped it
moving. I was surprised at how well this worked because I couldn&rsquo;t work out the
orientation at first. It pushes in from above.</p>
<div class="photos">
<p><a href="images/usb-wedge-installed.webp"><img src="images/usb-wedge-installed.webp" alt="USB-C wedge installed"></a></p>
</div>
<p>This was probably the trickiest part of the whole process.</p>
<p>Sliding the battery was easy, but I couldn&rsquo;t work out how to connect the battery
to the PCB and I hadn&rsquo;t been observant enough during the keyboard disassembly to
recall how it fitted.</p>
<p>Turns out that the battery flex cable pushed straight down onto the PCB
connector. It made a positive click.</p>
<div class="photos">
<p><a href="images/battery-and-case-ready-to-be-installed.webp"><img src="images/battery-and-case-ready-to-be-installed.webp" alt="Case with battery ready to be installed"></a></p>
<p><a href="images/battery-installed-in-case.webp"><img src="images/battery-installed-in-case.webp" alt="Battery installed in the case"></a></p>
</div>
<p>Now I just had to close it all up. I slide the lid on over the battery and
screwed it in. Again the screws are bit fiddly. Half the battle was getting the
screws to stay on the screwdriver whilst I put them in.</p>
<div class="photos">
<p><a href="images/completed-with-case-screwed-shut.webp"><img src="images/completed-with-case-screwed-shut.webp" alt="Completed TouchID Trackpad case screwed shut"></a></p>
</div>
<p>Slide in the Apple Trackpad. Profit!</p>
<div class="photos">
<p><a href="images/finished.webp"><img src="images/finished.webp" alt="Apple Trackpad slid into the finished TouchID Trackpad build"></a></p>
</div>
<p>Not too bad at all.</p>
